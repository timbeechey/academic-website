abstract: 'An R package for quantifying hypothesis-to-data fit for repeated measures and longitudinal data, as described by Thorngate (1987) <doi:10.1016/S0166-4115(08)60083-7> and Grice et al., (2015) <doi:10.1177/2158244015604192>. Hypothesis and data are encoded as pairwise relative orderings which are then compared to determine the percentage of orderings in the data that are matched by the hypothesis.'
