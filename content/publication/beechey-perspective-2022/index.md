abstract: '**Purpose:** The purpose of this letter is to draw attention to recent literature regarding the communication abilities and experiences of Autistic people and the potential for detrimental effects on mental health and service provision resulting from behavior modification programs. I will argue that viewing Autistic communication as characterized by pragmatic language impairment is inconsistent with evidence of effective and positive communication between Autistic people and with the social model of disability. 

**Conclusion:** Proposals for interventions targeting Autistic people should carefully weigh the costs and benefits for Autistic people and should integrate the perspectives of Autistic people.'
